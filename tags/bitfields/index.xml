      <description>What Are Bitfields? The C programming language was a product of a time where it was extremely important to use as little space as possible. Memory was generally much more limited than it is today. Naturally, bitfields were one attempt to reduce memory usage.

Some domains, like embedded hardware, still require minimal memory footprints.</description>
